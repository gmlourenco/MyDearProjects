        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p>
            I'm a student of software engennering trying to improve my developer skills.
            If you like my work and want to contact me I'll leave my email below.
        </p>

        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>
            This website was built with the intention of perfecting some skills like programing with html, javascript
            and css.
        </p>

        <h2>What will I find in this website?</h2>
        <p>Well... This question is harder to give an answer to.
            My website won't have any expert knowledge, however, I'll resume my thoughts about some projects I made, and
            I'll include some explanation about how to do them.
            If you want to try them out you're welcome to make your own versions of this projects and text me with some
            tips to improve my work or of course ask me your doubts.

            <h3>Programming Languages and Environments</h3>
            <h4>Linguagens e Ambientes de Programação (PT)</h4>
            <p>It was in this class that I first started programing in html and javascript.
                I had some base knowledge, also because of projects I started, however it was here I learned the most
                about it also because of the projects that were more interesting than my previous.

                        the gold and unlock a stair to the next level. Altough it's simplicity, I had a lot of fun
                        programing it because it
                        was the first time I could write some code and immediately see the result. It is a bit buggy
                        but, as long as you
                        don't die too much it's truly easy to pass throw every level.

            <h3>Graphical Computation and Interfaces</h3>
            <h4>Computação Gráfica e Interfaces (PT)</h4>
            <p>
                On the first semester of the third year, I had CGI, here we were introduced to webgl, we learned a lot
                from how webgl works to world coordinates, lights coordinates and camera coordinates. The following
                projects were done during the semester as a way of consolidating and evaluating knowledge.

                <h5>Osciloscope</h5>
                <p>
                    This was our first real project in webgl, and, despite the lack of knowledge I think it turned out
                    fine. As the name
                    says we needed to build an oscilloscope to draw the functions that are selectable in the functions
                    selection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The function is draw in real time, so the adjustable timescale adapts itself when you change it and
                    the rest is a bit self-explanatory.

        <p>Most of this projects were built with my collegue. I did NOT do them alone, it's not impossible what so ever
            to do them on your own but I can't take all the credits for it.</p>

        <p>
            The moment I started designing this website I started working on some new projects, it was time to finish
            some. As
            lots of other people I had started a bunch of project that I hadn't finished because of the most diverse
            reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
            If I wanted to be something more than another one, I was going to need to make a change, stop collecting
            that much not so consolidated knowledge and start to work with the tools that I had.

            <h3>Snake_V1</h3>
            <p>
                What could be a better first work than one of the most iconic games of all time? The snake.
            </p>
            <p>
                This first snake version I made is in webgl. Honestly, I had no internet when I was writing it's code,
                so, I
                could
                only clarify my doubts on previous projects I had with me at the moment. And of course, what a better
                way to
                start
                than with some fresh knowledge right?
            </p>
            <p>
                I was half way done, deciding and finishing are the real deals, so, I had to finish it as soon as I
                could. I
                gave myself an expiring date and so I started.
