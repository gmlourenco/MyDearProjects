        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p>
        I'm a student of software engennering trying to improve my developer skills. 
        If you like my work and want to contact me I'll leave my email below.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>
        This website was built with the intention of perfecting some skills like programing with html, javascript and css.      
        </p>

        <h2>What will I find in this website?</h2>
        <p>Well... This question is harder to give an answer to. 
            My website won't have any expert knowledge, however, I'll resume my thoughts about some projects I made, and I'll include some explanation about how to do them. 
            If you want to try them out you're welcome to make your own versions of this projects and text me with some tips to improve my work or of course ask me your doubts.

            <h3>Programming Languages and Environments</h3>
            <h4>Linguagens e Ambientes de Programação (PT)</h4>
            <p>It was in this class that I first started programing in html and javascript. 
                I had some base knowledge, also because of projects I started, however it was here I learned the most about it also because of the projects that were more interesting than my previous.

                        the gold and unlock a stair to the next level. Altough it's simplicity, I had a lot of fun programing it because it
                        was the first time I could write some code and immediately see the result. It is a bit buggy but, as long as you
                        don't die too much it's truly easy to pass throw every level.

            <p>
                On the first semester of the third year, I had CGI, here we were introduced to webgl, we learned a lot from how webgl works to world coordinates, lights coordinates and camera coordinates. The following projects were done during the semester as a way of consolidating and evaluating knowledge.

        <p>Most of this projects were built with my collegue. I did NOT do them alone, it's not impossible what so ever to do them on your own but I can't take all the credits for it.</p>
